# Frequently asked questions


### Why is the Google Analytics code at the bottom? Google recommends it be placed in the `head`.

The advantage to placing it in the `head` is that you will track a user's
pageview even if they leave the page before it has been fully loaded. However,
putting the code at the bottom keeps all the scripts together and reinforces
that scripts at the bottom are the right move.


### Do I need to upgrade my sites each time a new version of Mobile Boilerplate is released?

No. You don't normally replace the foundations of a house once it has been
built. There is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the latest changes
but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.


### Where can I get help for support questions?

Please ask for help on
